## What is MCM/ICM
> [COMAP](https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm)'s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) are international contests for high school students and college undergraduates. The contests challenge teams of up to three students to analyze, model, solve, and present solution reports to an open-ended application problem. In these contests research, analytics, and applied intelligence are just as important as time management and problem selection.

## What is Typst
Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use.
